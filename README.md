Hello everyone, this is my first DOM project. This project was really awesome, I learnt so much, it has features, such as grid resize, custom color, on/off grid lines, clear grid, shows current color, and an eraser, with standard colors on the right. Some challenges that took some time to figure out was being able to hold and paint. Another one was the browser was trying to grab onto some of the elements, that would mess up the elements. I really enjoyed making this, and hopefully you like it! Thank you!
